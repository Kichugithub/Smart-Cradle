With the increasing number of working parents, taking care of babies on a daily basis
has become a more challenging task. Many families rely on grandparents' help or
baby care facilities. However, it can be difficult for parents to monitor their babies
consistently. To address this challenge, we propose an Internet of Things-based Smart
Cradle System for real-time monitoring. The system utilizes NodeMCU Controller
Board and Wi-Fi connectivity to transmit sensor data to the server. It monitors
important parameters such as moisture and crying. When the baby cries, the cradle
automatically swings using a sound detection sensor and a servo motor. Parents can
remotely view their baby via a web camera and even activate a lullaby on the cradle
through the server equipped with a mini speaker. In addition, the prototype can detect
wetness using a sensor and send notifications to the parent. The fabricated prototype
is cost-effective, easy to use, and operates safely, allowing for convenient baby
monitoring anytime, anywhere.
